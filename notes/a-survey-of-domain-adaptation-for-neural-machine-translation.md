Since domain-specific corpora are usally scarce or nonexistent which leads to vanilla NMT poor performance in such scenarios, domain adaptation is so important.

Similar to SMT, this paper categorize domain adaptation for NMT into two main categories (overlap exists):

- Data centric
  - In-domain monolingual corpora 
  - synthetic corpora
  - parallel corpora 
- model centric 
  - training objective
  - NMT architecture
  - decoding algorithm
