# Preface

I had a depressing and frustrating experience with reading papers and trying to understand the behind theories and seemingly endless new terminologies. The worst thing is, when I go back from a weekend or even a lunch, I can barely remember what I've just learned. That feeling sucks. So I decided to collect all related sources and my own notes here.
